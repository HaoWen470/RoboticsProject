### step 1: Deep Ensembles estimation
Adapted Tensorflow code from this [repo](https://github.com/vvanirudh/deep-ensembles-uncertainty).  
Tested on sinusoidal toy dataset.

### step 2: Differentiable Particle Filters estimation
Original [implementation](https://github.com/tu-rbo/differentiable-particle-filters) from the authors.

### step 3: behavior cloning (bonus)
